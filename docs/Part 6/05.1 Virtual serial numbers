**Note**: This feature is applicable for IBM i virtual server instances (VSI) only.<br><br> A virtual serial number (VSN) can be assigned to a VSI to keep track of the installation, support entitlements, and licensing compliance for IBM i software. The VSN has seven digits and it is a unique string. A VSI is moved across systems with its associated VSN. Hence, when a VSN is associated with a VSI you need not pin the VSI to a host for licensing or entitlement purpose. The details of a VSN associated with a VSI can also be seen on the VSI details page.

1. Click **Virtual serial numbers** (**A**) option in the side menu under the PowerVS-L3-2025 workspace. You will see an empty list as the VSN feature is not used in this demonstration. When VSN feature is used, this page will show the VSN, the IBM i VSI associated with the VSN, and the VSN description.
